// This game takes inspiration from the VR wizard duel game where you have options to
// perform certain attacks or defenses but they take time (here the time to type).
// I can visualize the game easily for 2 players, and I am still thinking about if more
// players should be allowed and if there would be teams or a free-for-all depending
// on how players will be divided. 


// I am now thinking of making it a free for all, where players select which enemy player they want to "hit" with an attack
// (and even with teams this could work just need to track who is left alive for a team to win and place team mates on the 
// left side of the screen with the player), placing enemies on the right of the screen lined up with little health bars. 
// players will need to click or type something to select the enemy to target (maybe an array of enemy icons) and then type in
// either fast attack, heavy attack, or status effect to hurt the enemy.
